# a11 and TDD: A match made in heaven

In my opinion, Accessibility and Test Driven Development are a great match. And to prove it, I have done a presentation on JS Nation 2022 about it.

I have used plain JS and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) to create a small form to collect some information.

You can find the slides [here](https://github.com/ritamcastro/sharing-is-caring/blob/main/jsnation-2022/2022-06-16%20-%20Rita%20Castro%20-%20a11y%20and%20TDD%20-%20Slides.pdf) and the presentation is available on [GitNation Portal](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/a11y-and-tdd-a-perfect-match ).

## How it works

Clone the repo with:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ritamcastro/jsnation-2022-a11y-and-tdd.git
```

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm i
```

And make it 🏃🏻‍♂️ with:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Visit your favourite browser [here](http://localhost:8000) and check it out!
